# App Description 

I wanted to create a Personal Agent app.  This app provides a talented individual, in search of a professional agent, one of two choices: 

Be connected with professional, human, agent via a networking platform.  This will allow an individual to reach out to an Agent, or vice-versa, and eventually agree to work together. 
Self-Management with the help of AI - this route will allow a user to communicate with, likely, a form of ChatGPT-4 that is programmed to act as an Agent who is advising a client. 

The result is a hybrid-approach to the Personal Agent.

Of course, if you are using this app as someone who is already a Professional Agent, they can just log into this app and see potential clients theyâ€™d want to work with.
